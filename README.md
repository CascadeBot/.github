# The Cascade project has shutdown

This project started just under six years ago (September 2018) after the shutdown of the once popular [FlareBot](https://github.com/FlareBot/FlareBot) project. We started out with the goal of creating "the most customisable Discord bot"; over time, we refined the project around this idea.

## Progress
We made good progress, with our alpha version releasing a little under a year later, on 14 July 2019. It was around this time that our real lives started to get busy, and Cascade fell to the sidelines. 

We've tried a couple of times to spur on the development:
- In 2021, we decided to remove music and fun commands and instead focus on our custom command system
- In 2022, Discord released slash commands, spurring on a complete rewrite of the project 

While the rewrite was a good relaunch of the project, we started from scratch, meaning that our little motivation was now confronted with an enormous task.

Our real lives weren't the only demotivator; since we launched Cascade, Discord has introduced a considerable number of changes to its platform, meaning we had to adapt what we were working on multiple times to keep up. This was tiring and contributed to us not getting as much done as we would have liked. 

## Our conclusion
After six years, we've decided it's time to admit that we cannot see this project through and formally announce that it will not continue.

It's a shame because it feels like we're reaching a point where we could release Cascade. Unfortunately, with months between us working on the project, we don't think we'll get there anytime soon.

We want to thank everyone who has supported us with our ideas — we're sorry that there isn't anything to show for the time everyone has put in.
